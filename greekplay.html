        OED. Daughter, what must I think, or do?

        ANT. My sire!
        We must conform us to the people's will,
        Yielding ere they compel.

        OED. Give me thy hand.

        ANT. Thou hast it.

        OED. --Strangers, let me not
        Be wronged, when I have trusted you
        And come from where I stood!

        CH. Assure thee, from this seat
        No man shall drag thee off against thy will.

        OED. Farther?

        CH. Advance thy foot.

        OED. Yet more?

        CH. Assist him onward
        Maiden, thou hast thy sight.
